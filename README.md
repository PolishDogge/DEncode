## DEncode
A basic python encoding of messages

# How it works
Converts a message into numbers and stores them in a list, simple as!

For example, inputting 'Hello World' and encoding it will give you something like this;

`[[2, 270, 369], [1, 523, 619], [1, 520, 623], [1, 803, 906], [1, 106], [0, 156], [2, 114], [1, 785, 891], [1, 109], [1, 
862, 965], [1, 889, 984], 5]`

Update; File is present to eaisly show you how to use it, its as simple as that.

It defenitly can be improved but this is a concept that I have been thinking of making for a while.

Do whatever you want with it :)
